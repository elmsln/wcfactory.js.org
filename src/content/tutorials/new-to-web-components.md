title: New to web components?
---
<p>If you are new to web components and front end development in general, you may want to consider using <a href="https://open-wc.org/guide/">Open WC tooling</a>
 instead.</p>
<p>Open WC is a community dedicated to documentation, tooling and guides associated with web components more generally. It's a great place to start if you are just trying to make a few elements or if you want to build elements for use in your first project.</p>
<p>WCFactory is what you'll want to invest time in once you've gotten enough elements that you need a way of managing them all, and managing them across projects / teams. For just getting started though, give Open WC a shot, you won't regret it!</p>
